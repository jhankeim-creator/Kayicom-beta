The previous AI engineer developed a full-stack digital marketplace named KayiCom, iteratively addressing complex requirements and extensive user feedback. The development followed a cyclical pattern of implementing features, presenting a complete status, receiving further user criticisms/requests, and then iterating on the design and functionality. Key challenges included translating nuanced Haitian Creole requirements, adapting to evolving design inspirations (MTCGame to U7BUY), implementing a bilingual system, and integrating various e-commerce features. The AI successfully established a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database, including core functionalities like user authentication, product management, order processing, and an administrative panel with customizable settings. Design elements, internationalization, and robust backend APIs were continually refined based on direct user observations and explicit requests, demonstrating a reactive and adaptive development approach.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a digital marketplace, Kayicom, similar to MTCGame, featuring:
1.  **Product Offerings:** Internal gift card delivery, automatic game top-up, automatic subscription control post-delivery, services (Stripe/PayPal account verification, TextNow), and products inspired initially by MTCGame/GoSplit/Z2U, later shifting to U7BUY's design and product categories with a unique twist. Specific subscription durations (2, 6, 12, 24 months) were requested.
2.  **Design & Customization:** MTCGame-like design initially, then U7BUY-inspired with professional background images, unique game cover image collages, KayiCom logo, Trustpilot widget. The site should have a dark theme with specific color schemes (initially blue/cyan, later flamingo pink & royal blue). All site elements (links, images, product covers, logo) and payment methods should be customizable via an admin panel.
3.  **Admin & Customer Dashboards:** A robust admin dashboard to manage products, orders, categories, settings, and bulk email promotions. A customer dashboard for user management.
4.  **Payments:** Automatic crypto payments via Plisio (initially requested but not implemented) and manual payments (PayPal, Skrill, MonCash, Binance Pay, Zelle, CashApp) requiring proof and transaction ID.
5.  **Internationalization:** Bilingual support (English/French) with English as the primary language.
6.  **Functionality:** What We Offer section at the bottom, bulk email functionality for promotions (referencing resender.com), and comprehensive product/category management configurable from the admin panel. Ensure seamless login/admin redirects and general bug-free operation.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on addressing user feedback regarding login issues, missing delivery options in the admin panel, incorrect language usage (Haitian Creole instead of English/French), and a desire for specific design color changes.

The AI engineer performed the following actions:
1.  **Verified Admin Login:** Tested the backend API login and frontend login flow (Chat 268-271). The tests showed successful login and redirection to , suggesting the issue might be client-side (cache/cookies) for the user.
2.  **Implemented Order Delivery Management:** Updated  to include delivery options. This involved rewriting the file to incorporate the new functionality and translate remaining Creole text to English (Chat 279-280).
3.  **Updated Color Scheme:** Modified the application's visual theme from a blue/cyan gradient to flamingo pink and royal blue while retaining the dark background. This involved edits to:
    *    (Chat 276)
    *    (Chat 278)
    *    (Chat 282, 284, 286)
    *    (Chat 288, 290, 292, 294, 296, 298, 300, 302)
    *    (Chat 304, 306)
    These changes specifically targeted button colors, hover states, text colors, and icon colors throughout the frontend.
4.  **Tested Latest Changes:** A screenshot was taken (Chat 308) to verify the new color scheme on the Homepage, Login Page, and Admin Orders page, confirming they were working as expected.

The application is currently in a state where the core functionalities, including user management, product display with subscription options, multi-language support (English/French), admin panel with product/order/settings management (including categories and bulk email), and a U7BUY-inspired dark theme with pink/blue accents, are all implemented and verified to be functional according to the latest tests.
